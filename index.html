            <p class="hook">
                This website is my personal space on the internet where I experiment, learn, and build in public.
                I’m deeply interested in programming, artificial intelligence, and problem-solving, and I enjoy
                turning curiosity into real projects. Some parts of this site are still evolving, and that’s intentional.
                Every section reflects progress rather than perfection.

            <h2>My Skills & Journey</h2>
            <p>
                My journey into technology started with curiosity and gradually turned into consistent learning.
                I focus on building strong fundamentals first and then expanding into practical applications.

            <h2>Projects & Goals</h2>
            <p>
                I’m currently working on a project.
            </p>
            <p>
                This website itself is one of my first major projects. Over time, I plan to add structured project pages,
                Python-based features, and interactive elements inspired by AI-driven ideas.
            </p>
            <p>
                My long-term goal is to build a portfolio that reflects genuine growth, discipline,
                and curiosity rather than just finished outcomes.
            </p>
            <p>This journey is just beginning.</p>
