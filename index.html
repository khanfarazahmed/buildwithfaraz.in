                This website is my personal space on the internet where I experiment, learn, and build in public.
                Some parts are still evolving, and that’s intentional.

    <h2>My Coding Journey So Far</h2>

    <p><strong>Started with the Basics</strong></p>
    <p>
        I began by learning Python fundamentals such as variables, loops, conditionals, and functions through online
        tutorials and hands-on practice.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Dived into C++</strong></p>
    <p>
        I then explored C++ and object-oriented programming, building simple console-based applications and
        strengthening my understanding of algorithms.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Entered Web Development</strong></p>
    <p>
        My journey continued into web development with HTML and CSS, later adding JavaScript for interactivity.
        This website represents my first major step into building something public and meaningful.
    </p>

    <p><strong>What’s Next</strong></p>
    <p>
        Next, I plan to integrate Python with web frameworks like Flask, add more projects, and fully launch this
        site as a polished personal portfolio.

    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p><strong>Hi, I’m Faraz Ahmed Khan</strong></p>

    <p>
        As a dedicated high school student currently in the 12th grade, I am deeply passionate about the intersection
        of code, mathematics, artificial intelligence, and emerging technologies. My journey into programming began
        with a strong curiosity for problem-solving and innovation, which continues to drive my motivation to grow
        beyond classroom learning.
    </p>

    <p>
        Beyond formal academics, I actively work on meaningful projects that blend creativity with technical skills.
        I am particularly interested in agentic AI and related domains, where intelligent systems are designed to
        adapt, reason, and evolve autonomously.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Skills</strong></p>

    <p>
        I have a solid foundation in C++, with experience in object-oriented programming and algorithmic thinking.
        Python is my strongest language, enabling me to build scripts, automate tasks, and prototype ideas efficiently.
        Alongside this, I am expanding my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript through real-world projects.
    </p>

    <p><strong>What I’m Working On</strong></p>

    <p>
        Currently, I am refining my Python skills while expanding my web development knowledge. This website is my
        first major project and serves as a living record of my learning journey, with plans to integrate backend
        logic, interactive features, and structured project showcases.
